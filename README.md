# @cheesetan ðŸ§€

I'm a 15 year old iOS Developer from Singapore, and I am currently studying in the School of Science and Technology, Singapore. I help run the iOS app development classes in my school's Coding Talent Development Program (SST Inc.) by creating lesson slides and recording lesson videos, and teaching around 50+ of my juniors every week. I am also one of the 350 winners of Apple's Swift Student Challenge in 2023, and gave a presentation about my winning project at Apple Orchard Road.
